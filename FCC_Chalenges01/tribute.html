            <p>Brian Patrick Carroll (born May 13, 1969), known professionally as Buckethead, is an American musician,
                songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. He has received critical acclaim for his innovative electric
                guitar playing. His music spans several genres, including progressive metal, funk, blues, bluegrass,
                ambient, and avant-garde music. He performs primarily as a solo artist, although he collaborated with a
                wide variety of artists such as Bill Laswell, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, Iggy Pop, Les Claypool,
                Serj Tankian, Bill Moseley, Mike Patton, Viggo Mortensen, That 1 Guy, Bassnectar, and Skating Polly. He
                was also a member of Guns N' Roses from 2000 to 2004. He has recorded 325 studio albums, four special
                releases, and one EP. He has performed on more than fifty albums by other artists.

            <p>Buckethead performs wearing a KFC bucket on his head, emblazoned with an orange bumper sticker reading
                FUNERAL in block letters, and an expressionless plain white mask inspired by Halloween 4: The Return of
                Michael Myers. At one point, he changed to a plain white bucket without a KFC logo, but subsequently
                reverted to his emblematic KFC bucket, but without the funeral sticker. He also incorporates nunchaku
                and robot dancing into his stage performances.
